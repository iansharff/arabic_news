    "This is the initial model created by assembling a corpus news articles written in Modern Standard Arabic (العربية الفصحى). These articles were obtained from <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/haithemhermessi/sanad-dataset\">this dataset from Kaggle</a>, and consist of 7 categories, each with 6,500 articles. First, count vectorization was performed with the 10,000 most common words (removing the 750 most common Arabic stopwords, obtained from <a href= \"https://github.com/mohataher/arabic-stop-words/blob/master/list.txt\">here</a>), and training a Multinomial Naïve Bayes model with 80% of the stratified data, reserving the remaining 20% for testing."
